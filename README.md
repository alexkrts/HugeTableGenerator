The project, which generates a new table. 
The generation is done by multiplying the height and width of the input table.
Main probles is to generate new cell indexes(for example if new size will be 3*height X 4*width) for new cells 
and expressions for navigation across the new table.

input file: 002_simple.in (size 3*5)
output file: 002_simple_huge.in (new size 90*150)
